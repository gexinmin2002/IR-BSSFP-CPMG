# IR-BSSFP-CPMG
The code attached to 'An improved method to accelerate the acquisition efficiency of the T1-T2 spectrum based on the IR-BSSFP-CPMG pulse sequence'

The file includes two folders.

The 'forward' contains code for constructing forward model and the simulated magnetization of forward models.

The code in 'invert' is used to draw an inverted 2D spectrum with the same style as the forward model. 
'XX' and 'YY' are the T1 and T2 points same as in the forward model, respectively. 
The data in '2D_Distribution' is generated by Upen2DTool inversion software.
